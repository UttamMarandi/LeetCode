// The code above will output xyz as output. Here emp1 object got company as prototype property. delete operator doesn't delete prototype property.
// emp1 object doesn't have company as its own property. you can test it console.log(emp1.hasOwnProperty('company')); //output : false However, we can delete company property directly from Employee object using delete Employee.company or we can also delete from emp1 object using __proto__ property delete emp1.__proto__.company.

// Code 47

var trees = ["xyz", "xxxx", "test", "ryan", "apple"];

console.log(trees.length);

// The code above will output 5 as output. When we used delete operator for deleting an array element then, the array length is not affected by this. This holds even if you deleted all elements of an array using delete operator.

// So when delete operator removes an array element that deleted element is no longer present in the array. In place of value at deleted index undefined x 1 in chrome and undefined is placed at the index. If you do console.log(trees) output ["xyz", "xxxx", "test", undefined Ã— 1, "apple"] in Chrome and in Firefox ["xyz", "xxxx", "test", undefined, "apple"].

// The code above will print string "undefined" as output. According to associativity rule operator with the same precedence are processed based on their associativity property of operator. Here associativity of the assignment operator is Right to Left so first typeof y will evaluate first which is string "undefined" and assigned to z and then y would be assigned the value of z. The overall sequence will look like that:

// var z;
// z = 1;
// var y;
// z = typeof y;
// y = z;
