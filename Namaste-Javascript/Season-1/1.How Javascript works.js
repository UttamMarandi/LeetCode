//
// Everything is javascript happens inside an execution context

// All js code is executed inside this execution context.

// Execution context has two components :
//1. Memory Component : All the variables and functions are stored as key value pairs. Also called Variable enviroment
//2. Code component : All the code is executed in the code component one line at a time. It is also known as thread of execution.

// Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language. Jacascript can execute code one line at a time in a particular order that is top to bottom
