# 2367. Number of Arithmetic Triplets

You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array nums and a positive integer diff. A triplet (i, j, k) is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions are met:

i < j < k,
nums[j] - nums[i] == diff, and
nums[k] - nums[j] == diff.
Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.

```

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10], diff = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
(1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
(2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3.
```

## Solutions

## Brute force

Time Complexity : O(n^3)

```
  const returnTriplets = (nums, diff) => {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
      for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length - 1; j++) {
        for (let k = j + 1; k < nums.length; k++) {
          if (nums[j] - nums[i] == diff && nums[k] - nums[j] == diff) {
            count++;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    return count;
  };

  console.log(returnTriplets([1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14], 3)); // 0
  console.log(returnTriplets([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 2)); // 3

```

This code defines a function countArithmeticTriplets that takes two arguments: an array nums and an integer diff. The function iterates through all possible combinations of three elements in the array nums and checks whether they form an arithmetic triplet.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n^3), since it iterates through the array nums three times.

### Questions

```
Why we are using

i < nums.length - 2

for first loop?

```

The first loop continues until i is equal to nums.length - 2, so the condition i < nums.length - 2 ensures that the loop does not go beyond the second-to-last element of the array.

The reason for this is that the function is looking for arithmetic triplets of the form (nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]). If i is equal to nums.length - 2 or greater, then j and k will be out of bounds, since they must be greater than i and less than nums.length.

```
Why we are setting j=i+1 and j<nums.length -1 for 2nd loop
```

The condition j = i + 1 ensures that j is always greater than i, which is necessary for the triplet (nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]) to be valid. Similarly, the condition j < nums.length - 1 ensures that j is always less than k, which is also necessary for the triplet to be valid.

## O(n^2) solution

```
  const arithmeticTriplets = (nums, diff) => {
    let count = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
      if (nums.includes(num + diff) && nums.includes(num + diff * 2)) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    return count;
  };

  console.log(arithmeticTriplets([0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10], 3));

```

The function begins by initializing a counter count to 0. Then, it uses a for...of loop to iterate through the elements of the array nums. For each element num, the function checks whether the array nums includes the elements num + diff and num + diff \* 2. If both of these elements are present in the array, the function increments the counter count.

### Questions

```
What is the time and space complexity
```

The time complexity of the function arithmeticTriplets is O(n^2), since it uses a for...of loop to iterate through the elements of the array nums, and for each element it uses the Array.prototype.includes() method to check whether the array includes two other elements. The Array.prototype.includes() method has a time complexity of O(n), so the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

The space complexity of the function is O(1), since it only uses a constant amount of space to store the counter count.

## O(nlogn) solution

```
  const arithmeticTriplets = (nums, diff) => {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
      let j = binarySearch(nums, nums[i] + diff, i + 1, nums.length - 1);
      let k = binarySearch(nums, nums[j] + diff, j + 1, nums.length - 1);
      if (k !== -1) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    return count;
  };

  const binarySearch = (array, target, start, end) => {
    while (start <= end) {
      let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
      if (array[mid] === target) {
        return mid;
      } else if (array[mid] < target) {
        start = mid + 1;
      } else {
        end = mid - 1;
      }
    }
    return -1;
  };

  console.log(arithmeticTriplets([0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10], 3)); //2

```

The function begins by initializing a counter count to 0. Then, it uses a for loop to iterate through the elements nums[i] of the array nums. For each element nums[i], the function uses the binarySearch function to find the indices j and k such that the triplet (nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]) is an arithmetic triplet.

This binarySearch function performs a binary search for a target element in a given array. It takes four arguments: the array to search, the target element to find, and the start and end indices to search within the array.

The function begins by entering a while loop that continues until the start index start becomes greater than the end index end. Within the loop, the function computes the midpoint index mid of the current search range by taking the floor of the average of start and end.

Then, the function checks whether the element at index mid is the target element. If it is, the function returns mid and the binary search is complete. If the element at index mid is not the target element, the function checks whether it is less than the target element. If it is, the function updates the start index to mid + 1, which narrows the search range to the right half of the current range. If the element at index mid is greater than the target element, the function updates the end index to mid - 1, which narrows the search range to the left half of the current range.

If the while loop completes without finding the target element, the function returns -1 to indicate that the element was not found.

```
What is time and space complexity for this code?
```

The time complexity of the function countArithmeticTriplets is O(n log n), because it uses the binarySearch function to search for elements in the array nums. The binarySearch function has a time complexity of O(log n), so the overall time complexity of the countArithmeticTriplets function is O(n log n).

The space complexity of the countArithmeticTriplets function is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the counter count.

The space complexity of the binarySearch function is also O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables start, end, and mid.
